# Mock-CC-Base-Theme-Docs

I created this repository to document and share my prototype for the CC WP Base Theme.
It was created from the [Jamdocs](https://jamdocs.samuelhorn.com/) gridsome starter by Samuel Horn.

Stack
- [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/): a static site generator for Vue.js
- [Jamdocs](https://jamdocs.samuelhorn.com/) : a minimalist gridsome starter by Samuel Horn which makes it fast to get started with technical documentation.
